[Não entende inglês? Clique aqui para ver indicações em Português!](https://github.com/rochabianca/the-great-courses-of-the-Internet/blob/master/README_pt-br.md)

The Internet is full of great courses, but the internet is also full of courses. This repository is a attempt to help you to find the great courses of the internet. Enjoy and if you know any great course, please, contribute!

For easy search, I'm putting tags alongside with each indication, such like `any`, `javascript`, `react`, etc. If there is a indication with a whole website (and is not a huge website like Udemy, Alura, etc) please, put on the tags the type of technologies that that website teaches.
